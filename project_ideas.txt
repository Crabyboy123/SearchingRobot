Some ideas on how implementation, feel free to add

// color sensor doc: http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/sensors/lego-ev3-color-sensor/

enum from colors the sensor is able to detect:
Color
0	none
1	black
2	blue
3	green
4	yellow
5	red
6	white
7	brown

while (colorSensor.COL-AMBIENT > 60) {
	searchForObject();
}

// do something with different colors
// add some different actions for different colors 
if (colorsensor.COL-AMBIENT < 60){
	color = colorSensor.COL-COLOR  // switch mode to color recognition and get color of object
	swich (color)
	case (black)
		--> continue searchForObject
	case (blue)
		-->  continue searchForObject
	case (green)
		--> continue  searchForObject
	case (yellow)
		-->  continue searchForObject
	case (red)
		----> desired object found: do something (go back to starting point, calculate a direct route)
	case (white)
		-->  continue searchForObject
	case (brown)
		-->  continue searchForObject
}


searchForObject() {
	while (notFound) {
		moveForward(20) // I don't know what units this would use, but anyway the idea I had was to go in some pattern and advance to search the whole area
		turnRight() // do a U-turn and repeat
	}
}
